# AI Face Scanner Test

This project demonstrates a simple AI-powered application that utilizes a webcam for real-time face recognition and emotion detection. It uses TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Mediapipe (optional) to provide the foundational tools for building an advanced facial recognition system.

## Features

- Real-time webcam feed processing.
- Integration with TensorFlow for AI model support.
- Basic setup for facial recognition and emotion detection.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment setup (recommended)
- Required Python libraries:
  - TensorFlow
  - OpenCV
  - Mediapipe (optional)
